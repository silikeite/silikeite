### Hi, I'm Kei, and nice to meet you! 👋

I'm Kei, known on the interwebs as `silikeite`. I'm a developer with eclectic interests, ranging from hardware design to ML to even cooking (let me cook) and music.

I'm currently working as an Engineering Intern at Smartfox Data Solutions, and studying BS Electronics Engineering at University of the Philippines Diliman.
